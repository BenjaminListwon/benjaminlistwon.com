      <description>The old site was getting a little clunky, despite being only a few months in service. I had never intended for the design to last very long in the first place, and I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to get anywhere near the level of traction I got for some posts. Thank you all for reading!
This new site is running on Hugo, an amazing static site generator written in Go. If you are looking to start any sort of content-driven site, or feel like the old one is outgrowing its roots, I encourage you to give Hugo a serious look.</description>
