      <description>Someone recently shared a link to Has Design Become Too Hard?, an article by Jeffrey Zeldman about the changing landscape of designing for the web and the tools that we use to do that job. [1]
Ignoring the salesmanship for a moment, the article makes a couple of important points, and misses something I think we overlook in our profession: not everyone wants to do it all on their own.</description>

      <description>Last week, Rob Brackett tweeted a link to A web for everyone, an article by Jeremy Keith. In that article, Jeremy discusses the need to build products for the web that are accessible to all audiences, not just those with bleeding edge functionality:
 I wish we could make offline functionality a requirement. But the reality is that not everyone is using a browser that supports the necessary technology. I wish we could make beautiful typography a requirement.</description>

      <description>Last Wednesday, Mike Rundle tweeted about Smartisan’s T2, an Android phone that features a completely custom UI:
Wow, Smartisan OS is a custom Android implementation with truly beautiful icons and UI work. https://t.co/Zk8Bh9gd2T pic.twitter.com/FUiqXFYYbX
— Mike Rundle (@flyosity) May 18, 2016 It looks awesome—the phone, the OS, everything. Anyway, a short time later in Slack, someone shared the same tweet and asked:
 I admit that maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t get design, because I&amp;rsquo;m not a designer by trade … but is iOS 6-style design really &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; as many designers imply, or is it just a retro factor/change is hard/other things I may not understand?</description>

      <title>Respons-O-Matic Part 2</title>

      <description>Yesterday I pushed out Respons-O-Matic, a very simplistic tool to preview RWD layouts, without much thought to how others might use it. Unsurprisingly, a few folks had some really great feedback on their own workflows, and how to make Respons-O-Matic play nicer.
Check out the updated demo if you want to see it in action, or head to the repository on Github for the code.
Here’s what’s new or different:</description>

      <description>This weekend I was testing out some new layouts I’ve been working on, and I built myself a little tool to preview Responsive (RWD) layouts more easily.
I thought it might be of use to some other folks as well.
It looks like this:

And you can check out a demo or go snag the repository on Github and have at it.
Further Reading As I write in the FAQ section of the repo, Respons-O-Matic is not meant to be a substitute for real, on-device testing, or anything else for that matter.</description>
