      <description>Yesterday, I created a GitHub organization so that I could house all of the projects my LLC is working on under one roof. The re-homing process from my individual GitHub user account to the organization could not have been smoother.

      <description>If you read my last In Brief post, you may have tried setting up a cron job to run mysqldump nightly, gone back to check the results the following day and found a zero byte file where you expected to see a dumpfile.
