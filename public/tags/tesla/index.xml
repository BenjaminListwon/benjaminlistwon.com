      <description>Tesla v Fortune Just a few hours after I posted yesterday, a couple different folks directed me to Tesla’s blog post regarding the Joshua Brown’s fatal crash on ‘autopilot’ and an article by Fortune that is critical of Tesla and CEO Elon Musk.
It took me some time to digest both pieces, as well as some additional information surrounding them, but the timelines they present are clearly different than those that were more broadly reported in the media.</description>

      <description>Update (July 06, 8:00PM): Someone pointed out Tesla&amp;rsquo;s rebuttal to a Fortune article which presents different information about the timeline of Joshua Brown&amp;rsquo;s death. The only date I have referred to below is June 30, the date of Tesla&amp;rsquo;s press release, while it appears the accident itself occurred on May 7.
I will write more tomorrow about the new information both articles present, as well as a response to some questions about my position on innovation, &amp;lsquo;autopilot&amp;rsquo; and technology.</description>
