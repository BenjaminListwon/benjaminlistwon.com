      <description>The old site was getting a little clunky, despite being only a few months in service. I had never intended for the design to last very long in the first place, and I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to get anywhere near the level of traction I got for some posts. Thank you all for reading!
This new site is running on Hugo, an amazing static site generator written in Go. If you are looking to start any sort of content-driven site, or feel like the old one is outgrowing its roots, I encourage you to give Hugo a serious look.</description>

      <description>It’s been a long summer so far, but it has seemingly flown by. I know it has been a while since I’ve posted anything here, but it is for a couple of great reasons.
First, I’ve been spending some more time with my son—playing basketball, biking, hunting for blackberries (and Pokemon)—and with friends, both new and lifelong. Getting to spend time with people I love and whose opinions and outlook I value has been restorative and very welcome.</description>

      <description>Wowzers, have the days simply flown by in April! It has been a little while since my last post, and this one is going to be a brief one to be sure, but I wanted to catch up to what’s been going on this month.
Reboot! First up, May 1st Reboot is right around the corner. Just three days left to crank! If you’re launching, relaunching or just breathing new life into something on the web, you should check it out and follow #May1Reboot to see what our colleagues and community are up to.</description>

      <title>Why Laravel? Why Now?</title>

      <description>(Update: Can&amp;rsquo;t believe I forgot Laracasts when I wrote about the Laravel ecosystem below.)
First, a confession. I’ve only been doing “serious” Laravel development for about four or five weeks now.
In fact, it has been about a decade since I did any serious PHP development at all.
I’m still getting my hands dirty digging through how Laravel works, and I’m certainly a way off from “mastery” of the framework, but the single best way to learn a new language, technology or framework is to have a project, a timeline, and to just get cracking.</description>
