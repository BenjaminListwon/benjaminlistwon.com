      <title>Vuex Chat Part 2</title>

      <description>In my last post, we took a look at how you might implement shared state in your Vue.js app by comparing a vuex implementation with a hand-coded alternative. Incorporating vuex, as we saw, is pretty straightforward once the core concept of one-way data flow in Vue makes sense.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take the demo a little further by introducing modules, constants for mutation names, and organizing our actions a bit differently.</description>

      <title>Data Flow in Vue and Vuex</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Update 10/14/16: This article has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jianshu.com/p/2e0b6d19dd6a&#34;&gt;translated into simplified Chinese&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sqrtthree&#34;&gt;@sqrtthree&lt;/a&gt;. Also &lt;a href=&#34;http://gold.xitu.io/entry/58007bcf0bd1d00058eefe69/&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like one of the things that trips people up in &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org&#34;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt; is how to share state across components. For those new to reactive programming, something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/&#34;&gt;vuex&lt;/a&gt; can seem daunting with loads of new jargon and the way it separates concerns. It can also seem like overkill when all you want is to share one or two pieces of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Short Order Vue: A Vue 2.0 App</title>

      <description>On Wednesday I shared some of the resources Iâ€™ve been using to move from previous releases of Vue to the new Vue 2.0 API. (BTW: Iâ€™ve got a few more links to add, thanks to some great folks on Twitter.) The biggest changes in 2.0 arenâ€™t really in the API itself, but there are a few tricky bits here and there.
As Iâ€™ve proceeded, Iâ€™ve found it is a little easier to just start some mini projects from scratch to test out some of the new functionality, as opposed to trying to reason about how to rewrite old code.</description>

      <description>(Update 11/14/16: This article has been translated into Japanese by Chiharu Shibata.)
A couple weeks back I got back from holiday, my son started the new school year, and once again the home office was calm and quiet. While I was away, someone had reached out about a Vue component I mentioned I was writing to use a Handsontable (HOT) in a Vue app. I mentioned that I was about to start converting it over to Vue 2.</description>
