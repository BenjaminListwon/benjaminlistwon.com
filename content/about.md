Hello,

I am a designer, developer, and proud father, living in the greater Seattle area. I have spent the last two decades building apps, websites and software with some terrific folks, and now I am striking out on my own.

I started this blog to document all the technical challenges, a-ha moments and little nuggets I come across as I build digital products, learn new technolgies, and push my own skillset. I’m no software expert, and I will probably get loads of things wrong, but I love to learn and to share in the spirit of building a better community for us all.

[Friends And Family Software](https://friendsandfamilysoftware.com) is where I will be launching my new products. Soon, you’ll find a blog there about building software for those we care a lot about and what it means to build personal, compassionate products.

I’m also working on a couple of other writing projects. One is very personal, and will be found at [A Life Alone](https://alifealone.com). It would be too simple to call it a blog, but it won’t read like a book either. It is something else; an experiment. The other is a YA fantasy novel, based on a tale I’ve wanted to tell since I was ten.

If you’d like to get in touch, go ahead and [send an email](mailto:ben@benjaminlistwon.com).

Thanks for stopping by!

PS: If you are looking for my complete CV, [look no further](/personal/cv/).
