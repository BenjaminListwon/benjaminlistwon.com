The old site was getting a little clunky, despite being only a few months in service. I had never intended for the design to last very long in the first place, and I certainly didn't expect to get anywhere near the level of traction I got for some posts. Thank you all for reading!

This new site is running on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an amazing static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). If you are looking to start any sort of content-driven site, or feel like the old one is outgrowing its roots, I encourage you to give Hugo a serious look. It is painless to set up, a pleasure to use, and integrates with almost any build toolchain you may already have, since you merely exec a binary. Heck, I can even get away with deploying via rsync now, waaaaaat?!?!?

Thanks to [Steve Francia](https://twitter.com/spf13) for building such a great tool, and [Nathan Peretic](https://twitter.com/nathanperetic) for the reccomendation (so long ago now, it seems).

I didn't really want to invest a lot in building out a theme, as I have three other projects going on right now, and getting off a dynamic backend was the big goal here. With that in mind, I found this feature-rich theme, [Future Imperfect](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect) by [Julio Pescador](https://twitter.com/julio_pescador). It is __packed__ with great features. Now I just need to optimize the CSS and JS I actually use (lose what I don't) and I can make the site really sing.

That's it for today. Back to some posts on Vue.js and app building on Wednesday!
