It never fails. Just a few hours after I hit publish on my last post, the great folks behind Vue.js and the boilerplate templates, cranked out a [new template aimed at beginners](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/simple). You just use node to install the [Vue cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) _(think Composer)_ and use it to pull in the template.

The result? A single page HTML file that pulls Vue in from a CDN and you are off and running. 

If you were thinking of giving Vue a whirl, and were still worried about the set up, worry no more.
