[![](/postimg/respons-o-matic/respons-o-matic.png "Respons-O-Matic")](/demo/responsomatic)

Yesterday I pushed out [Respons-O-Matic](https://github.com/BenjaminListwon/responsomatic), a very simplistic tool to preview RWD layouts, without much thought to how others might use it. Unsurprisingly, a few folks had some really great feedback on their own workflows, and how to make Respons-O-Matic play nicer.

[Check out the updated demo](/demo/responsomatic) if you want to see it in action, or head to the [repository on Github](https://github.com/BenjaminListwon/responsomatic) for the code.

Here’s what’s new or different:

* simple text box to enter URLs and filenames; no more config
* recent URL history
* rotate the iDevices by clicking the home button
* reworked the entire project directory to make integration with your projects much, much smoother
* added a port option to the server script (in case 8080 is in use)

Thanks for stopping by!
