This weekend I was testing out some new layouts I’ve been working on, and I built myself a little tool to preview Responsive (RWD) layouts more easily. 

I thought it might be of use to some other folks as well. 

It looks like this:

[![](/postimg/respons-o-matic/respons-o-matic.png "Respons-O-Matic")](/demo/responsomatic)

And you can [check out a demo](/demo/responsomatic) or go snag the [repository on Github](https://github.com/BenjaminListwon/responsomatic) and have at it.

## Further Reading

As I write in the [FAQ section](https://github.com/BenjaminListwon/responsomatic#faq) of the repo, Respons-O-Matic is not meant to be a substitute for real, on-device testing, or anything else for that matter. 

I’m just tired of fiddling with more tools in my toolchain, having to keep a zillion devices around, and all the other hassle of RWD testing, just so I can preview a screen or two.

It may not be for you, or for anyone for that matter, but what the hell, right?

## Side Note

I’m a really forgetful person when it comes to syntax and whatnot. _(That’s why I love [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), btw.)_ 

As a result, I had a bookmark in my bookmark bar to the Github Git Cheat Sheet, which recently moved to [https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf](https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).
