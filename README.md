# The benjaminlistwon.com Repo

Hey y'all, this is the repo I use for [benjaminlistwon.com](https://benjaminlistwon.com). It pretty basic:

- The site is statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a project from [Steve Francia](http://spf13.com/)
- The theme is a lightly tweaked version of [Future Imperfect](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect) by [Julio Pescador](https://jpescador.com)
- Content is all my own

Come check it out, if you have a minute. Thanks.
